## News Article Summarization
The information age has paved the way to social media which has enabled humans a unique way to earn income by documenting every event in and around themselves. This has resulted in a rise of grassroots journalism where almost nothing is in the information shadows around the world. And with so much happening around the world in terms of geopolitics, war, refugee, and weather crisis there is so much news being produced on a daily basis that it is impossible for any human or even an organization like governments or a think tank to consume and provide relevant analysis. So, in this project, we tackle the problem of summarizing news articles using supervised learning techniques. We plan to use CNN/DailyMail Dataset which is an English-language dataset containing just over 300k unique news articles as our training dataset to develop a model that will be able to summarize any news article we provide as an input.
